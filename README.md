# Credit_Risk_Classification
CreditSecure Solutions, a financial services startup, aims to build a robust machine learning model to classify credit risk for loan applicants. The goal is to accurately assess the likelihood of a borrower defaulting on a loan and classify them as "low-risk" or "high-risk." This classification will empower the company's underwriting team to make data-driven decisions, minimize default rates, and improve overall portfolio performance.

Given the rise of digital lending platforms and the rapid scaling of loan disbursements, it's critical for CreditSecure Solutions to implement an automated and scalable solution that enhances decision-making efficiency while maintaining fairness and transparency.

Project Overview: The Credit Risk Classification project leverages historical loan data to train and evaluate machine learning models capable of classifying credit risk. This repository includes the complete workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset used for this project includes the following columns:

1.person_age: Age of the loan applicant.

2.person_income: Annual income of the applicant.

3.person_home_ownership: Type of home ownership (e.g., rent, mortgage, own).

6.loan_grade: Credit grade assigned to the applicant.

7.loan_amnt: Amount of the loan requested.

8.loan_int_rate: Interest rate for the loan.

9.loan_status: Final status of the loan (e.g., fully paid, charged off).

10.loan_percent_income: Ratio of the loan amount to the applicant's annual income.
